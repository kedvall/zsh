## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo, ideally into your home directory
2. Run `install.sh` (will likely need `sudo` privileges)
3. Verify `.zshrc`, `.oh-my-zsh/custom/custom.zsh`, and `.direnvrc` are created as expected
4. Restart your terminal

Alternatively, copy desired files to their appropriate locations then restart your terminal:
- `.zshrc` and `.direnvrc` should be placed in your home directory (`$HOME`)
- `custom.zsh` should be placed in `$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/`
